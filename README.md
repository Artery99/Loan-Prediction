# Loan Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook provides an end-to-end workflow for predicting loan approval using machine learning. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

# Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics and visualizations to understand important features.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluating classifiers for loan approval prediction.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and other key evaluation metrics.

# Requirements:
Python (with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
hvplot for interactive visualizations

# Usage:
Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.
Preprocess the data, including feature selection and normalization.
Train various ML models and evaluate their performance.
Visualize results and interpret findings.
